# Star Citizen French Localization

![Logo][FS]

*WIP*
This folder contains the localization file of Star Citizen in French that translate only the dialogues and descriptions but not the assets to let the players understand each others whatever the language of the game is (should be by default, but unexperienced French community have hard time to understand this).
